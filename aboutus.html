        <p class="mb-4">
            GrammarBuddy was created and developed by <strong>Varun K</strong>, with co-development by <strong>Yuvika V</strong>. What started as a simple idea grew into a comprehensive tool thanks to their dedication to making a real difference in how people engage with language. We're not a big corporation; we're just two people who love language and want to share that passion with the world.
        </p>
